[X]-Implement CGI
	-> Implement CGI parser that read header and reconstruct a http response according to cgi headers.
[X]-Implements all status code for CGI handling
[X]-Allocate each socket and fd object related in heap insetad of stack to prevent
    problem with copy in STL containers
[X]-Mapping of all unique ip:port for binding
    -> Priorize specific ip adress bedore wildcard ones
[X]-Rework base Architecture to listen on each port and redirect request on the 
    corrrect structure and have all sockets in one list and have servers where 
    the request will be redirected depending on mandatory HOST header
[X]-Handle connection state / close teh conenction when request malformed to 
    prevent integrity of the data
[X]-Refacto the way data is sent to allow all others things than just sending 
    static files.
[X]-Fix Idle should just close socket and error during response should close immediately
[X]-Body with content length of 0
[X]-Handle upload with diffrents content types not only plain/text
[X]-Make socket NON BLOCKING
[X]-Catch error in cgi pipes
[X]-Leaks on fork failed
[X]-Handle redirection for POST/DELETE 
    [X]-> In the config file ask for the redirection codes
[X]-Add custom responses errors
[X]-Wait for the cgi to close to send the resposne even if received
[X]-Set-Cookie issue
[X]-Problem with chunked response from cgi

-Handle range on downloaded files to get a part of file.
-Handle caching through ETAG to make client cache static files.
    -> Should look like ETag: "xxxxxxxx-yyyyyyyy" where x is the last 
       modification timestamp in hexa and y teh file content len in hexa.

// Prioritary

-Handle body size limit on request parsing
-Check if cgi file requested exist and if not return 404
-Make a list of duplicates headers if possible
-Remove hardcoded extension that makes no sense
-Check uri .. is still valid
